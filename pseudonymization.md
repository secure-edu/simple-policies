# Pseudonymisation in Education

The goal of this policy is to ensure Data Protection by Design and by Default within educational settings and alignment with GDPR and Data Protection Laws.

## Definitions

The definition of Pseudonymisation in GDPR Article 4(5) requires that the information value of data must be separated from the identity of data subjects and that additional securely stored information must be necessary to re-identify data subjects, and then only under controlled conditions. Under this definition, GDPR-compliant Pseudonymisation is now defined as an outcome and not a technique.

## Background

With the elevation of Pseudonymisation to an outcome, to achieve GDPR-compliant Pseudonymisation it has become necessary to protect not only direct identifiers but also indirect identifiers. In addition, instead of being applied only to individual fields, GDPR-defined Pseudonymisation, in combination with the GDPR definition for Personal Data,[^1] requires that the outcome must apply to a data set as a whole (the entire collection of direct identifiers, indirect identifiers and other attributes), and consideration must be given to the degree of protection applied to all attributes in a data set.

With respect to the GDPR Article 4(5) requirement that the additional information necessary to relink to the identity of data subjects be kept separately and subject to technical and organisational measures:

1. This refers to the outcome for a dataset, not just treatment of individual fields in isolation: and
2. Requires more than mere possession by the data controller or other authorised party of information enabling reidentification. Instead, this requires that technical and organisational measures are implemented that make it impracticable for third parties to identify an individual without access to the specific additional information held separately by the data controller or other authorised party.





### Footnotes

[^1]: GDPR Article 4(1) defines Personal Data as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.”
